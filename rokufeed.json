Many processors (including the widespread Intel Core series) expose privileged software interfaces to dynamically regulate processor frequency and operating voltage. We show that these privileged interfaces can be reliably exploited to undermine the system's security. In multiple case studies, we show how the induced faults in enclave computations can be leveraged in real-world..."

ZombieLoad is extremely powerful, as it leaks data from user-processes, the kernel, secure enclaves, and even across virtual machines. Moreover, ZombieLoad also works on CPUs where Meltdown is fixed in software or hardware. The Meltdown attack published in 2018 was a hardware vulnerability which showed that the security guarantees of modern CPUs do not always..."

Telephony is now merging many complex technologies (PSTN, cellular and IP networks) and enabling numerous services that can be easily monetized. However, security challenges for telephony are often neither well understood, nor well addressed. As a result, telephone networks attract a lot of fraud. In this talk, we will systematically explore the fraud in telephone networks, focusing on voice..."

Like Tor, mix networks protect metadata by using layered encryption and routing packets between a series of independent nodes. Mix networks resist vastly more powerful adversary models than Tor though, including global passive adversaries. In so doing, mix networks add both latency and cover traffic. We shall outline the basic components of a mix network, touch on their roles in resisting active and passive attacks, and discuss how the..."
